## Markdown support

marked: Doesn't support syntax highlighting in code snippets?
vue-markdown: Not compatible with Babel 7, and project looks a bit dead

Chosen: [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)
Demo [here](https://markdown-it.github.io/)

## TODO

Add remaining fields:
 - location
 - picture upload

Add vue-router

Call lambda that would add question to S3?

Review style of Markdown preview (titles, ul/li, etc...)
